#### Main Objective
In this project, we'll see how sound waves are generated in MATLAB software and then end up coding a theme song with the help of same software.
#### Description
We'll be setting up the sine waves that corresponds to a particular frequency in that domain.
f= frequency of sound
fs= sampling frequency
t= start point:1/fs: duration
a= sin(2*pi*f*t)
sound(b,fs)

NOTE: To get a preferred sound, sampling theorem should be satisfied
fs>2fmax

#### Conclusion
Any music can be created using MATLAB software just by knowing the frequencies of that note and adding a delay to the program depending on the beats in the song.
